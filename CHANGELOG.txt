What's new:

Version 0.0.7 (Mar 29, 2013):
* Proper fix for pt / pf distribution (PR#15162)

Version 0.0.6 (Jan 11, 2013):
Further R synchronization fixes the following bugs / adds the following features:
* qgeom() could return -1 for extremely small q. (PR#14967.)
* lgamma(x) for very small x (in the denormalized range) is no longer Inf with a warning.
* plogis(x, lower = FALSE, log.p = TRUE) no longer underflows early for large x (e.g. 800).
* Imported the simplified logic for T.quantile from R
* Added multivariate gamma function (MathFunctions.lmvgammafn)
* Added Wishart distribution sampling (random only)

Version 0.0.5 (Jan 09, 2013):
* Synchronized with R's patched of the same date. Fixes the following bugs:
-- qt(1e-12, 1.2) no longer gives NaN.
-- dt(1e160, 1.2, log=TRUE) no longer gives -Inf.
-- beta(a, b) could overflow to infinity in its calculations when one of a and b was less than one.  (PR#15075)
-- lbeta(a, b) no longer gives NaN if a or b is very small (in the denormalized range).

Version 0.0.4 (Jan 09, 2013):
* Fix for pt / pf distribution. (PR#15162)
* Added Fretchet, GEV, Generalized Pareto, Gumbel, and Reverse Weibull distributions

Version 0.0.3:
* Added Logarithmic distribution
* Fixed visibility of Binomial.quantile to public (as opposed to package)
* Increased constant precision on Shapiro-Wilk p-value computation
* Modified density, cumulative, and quantile method signature of Ansari
  distribution to allow single values (as opposed to arrays of values)
* Added random number generation for Kendall and Tukey distributions
* Added exact method for computing Spearman distribution
* Finalize the method signature of PolyGamma.dpsifn
* Added MathFunctions.log1px
